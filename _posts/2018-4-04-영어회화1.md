## So v s
나도 그런줄 알았어 = So did I 
I ==should== get out of this business and so ==shoud== you. 

우리가 대적해야할 상대
We are up against ~ = what we are up against
You have no idea WHAT WE ARE UP AGAINST, but NEITHER DO YOU

I am not sleepy
Me, either/neither
Neither am I

I am in a hurry and so are you 

## 주어가 길어질 경우
Bank robbery is not my style
Neither is Telling the truth

That wasn't an accident and neither will the next one that goes into your head

## 연습몇가지..
I'm a tight schedule
So am I 
He is my friend
So am I 나도 너의 친구지
So was I 나도 너의 친구였다.

You lost someone, I lost everyone and so will you
